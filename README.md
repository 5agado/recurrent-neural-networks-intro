# Recurrent Neural Networks Intro
Resources, utils and test code for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

I am working on polishing this code and generalize it even further, such that there is a clear separation between text generation and models training. The idea is that for the latter I can keep experimenting with different techniques and tools, and generate different models, while with the former I can provide a reusable text-generation interface for a multitude of use-cases.
